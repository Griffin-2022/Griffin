CREATE TABLE integers(i INTEGER);

SELECT i AS 'hello world' FROM integers

# without an AS clause this does not work

SELECT i 'hello world' FROM integers

# double quotes work everywhere
;
SELECT i "hello world" FROM integers

SELECT i AS "hello world" FROM integers

SELECT "hello world".i FROM integers AS 'hello world'

# but not without the AS clause
